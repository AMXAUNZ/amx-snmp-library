NetLinx SNMP Manager

This NetLinx SNMP manager module can send SNMP GET, GETNEXT, and SET 
requests to SNMPv1 agents, and can receive SNMP traps by SNMPv1 agents.

Whilst tested for broad compatibilty, this code should be considered a 
technology demo and should by carefully evaluated before using in a 
production environment.

This module uses a seperately included client connection manager, listening 
socket manager, and debug library for ease of adoption and customisation.
